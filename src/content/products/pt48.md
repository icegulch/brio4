Don't have time to pore over one of the many fine guidebooks on hiking the White Mountain 4000-Footers? This poster is here to help, distilling a wealth of data on the 48 New Hampshire 4000-foot peaks in a format similar to the Periodic Table of Elements. Given for each summit is a difficulty rating, elevation, elevation rank, # of trails at summit, view type, summit type, Federal designation, county location, land manager, region within the Whites, and more! Offset-printed on 80lb paper with an endurance gloss cover. A portion of this product's profits go directly to the [AMC Four Thousand Footer Club](http://www.amc4000footer.org/).
