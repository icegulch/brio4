  "description": "Are you a peakbagger? A chemist? A Colorado enthusiast? This print has you covered, distilling a wealth of data about Colorado's \"Fourteeners\" into a colorful 24\"x18\" print. The exact number of 14ers in Colorado is hotly contested. This print showcases 58 of them. Geographic data (elevation, elevation rank, range, prominence) and info about the standard route (class rating, approximate elevation gain, approximate distance, hazards score, foot traffic score, and land management considerations) are provided for each summit. Though decidedly not for use in the field (nor a substitute for real planning), it'll help you visualize these iconic peaks while you're stuck indoors. A portion of the profits from this print go directly to the [Colorado Fourteeners Initiative](https://www.14ers.org/).",
