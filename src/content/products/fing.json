  "description": "Reminiscent of vintage scientific identification posters, this print challenges you to become familiar with the topographic &quot;fingerprints&quot; of all of New Hampshire&#x27;s 4000-Footers. Adapted from the USGS &quot;US Topo&quot; series contour lines, the fingerprints are foil stamped in silver matte on 100# Neenah Classic Crest \"patriot blue\" paper. Since summits vary greatly in size, creative license was invoked in fitting each peak into a grid. Indeed, many summit shapes were reduced in size, with contour lines pruned in as systematic a way as possible. In two cases (Lincoln and Wildcat B), contours were added to give a better sense of those two summits&#x27; shapes.
