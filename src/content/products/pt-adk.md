Given for each summit is a difficulty rating, elevation in feet and meters, elevation rank, summit type, trail type, county, and region. Region colors reflect the 2020 re-zoning of the High Peaks by the NY Department of Enviornmental Conservation, while subtle shading differences preserve historic boundaries.
