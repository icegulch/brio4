Reminiscent of vintage scientific identification posters, this print challenges you to become familiar with the topographic "fingerprints" of all of New Hampshire's 4000-Footers.

Adapted from the USGS "US Topo" series contour lines, the fingerprints were printed by the top-shelf flatstock team at [New Duds Screenprinting](https://www.newduds.net/posters) in Colchester, VT, which allowed us to expand available colorways (timber green, nightshift blue, monarch red, and slate gray).

Since summits vary greatly in size, creative license was invoked in fitting each peak into a grid. Indeed, many summit shapes were reduced in size, with contour lines pruned in as systematic a way as possible. In two cases (Lincoln and Wildcat B), contours were added to give a better sense of those two summits' shapes.

As always, a portion of this product's profits go directly to the [AMC Four Thousand Footer Club](http://www.amc4000footer.org/).
