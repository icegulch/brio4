Reminiscent of vintage scientific identification posters, this print challenges you to become familiar with the topographic "fingerprints" of all of New Hampshire's 4000-Footers.

Adapted from the USGS "US Topo" series contour lines, the fingerprints are foil stamped in silver matte on 100# Neenah Classic Crest 'patriot blue' paper.Since summits vary greatly in size, creative license was invoked in fitting each peak into a grid.

Indeed, many summit shapes were reduced in size, with contour lines pruned in as systematic a way as possible. In two cases (Lincoln and Wildcat B), contours were added to give a better sense of those two summits' shapes.

In the fall of 2023, we reached out to the flatstock team at [New Duds Screenprinting](https://www.newduds.net/posters) in Colchester, VT to dabble with white ink and some new papers.

We picked four colors of [French Paper](https://www.frenchpaper.com/) with linen or cardstock textures. The colors included dark green, dark red, navy, and dark gray.

Suffice it to say, we're pleased as punch with the results!

As always, a portion of this product's profits go directly to the [AMC Four Thousand Footer Club](http://www.amc4000footer.org/).
