This pocket-size passport is ideal for keeping track of your climbs of the increasingly popular "New Hampshire 52 With a View" list. Created by the Over the Hill Hikers of Sandwich, NH, this list features Granite State mountains below 4000 feet in elevation that offer good views. Bound with a handsome dark green leatherette cover, it includes a page for each of the 52 peaks on which to log date, companions and hike notes. Included are two sets of small peel-off stamps for each peak - one to place on the individual peak page, and another to place on the two-page centerspread to track your overall progress in climbing the "52". The stamps are referenced to a peak abbreviation key on the back page of the passport. <mark>The Second Edition reflects the May 2020 list and features both current and "de-listed" destinations.</mark> A portion of this product's profits go directly to the [AMC Four Thousand Footer Club](http://www.amc4000footer.org/).
