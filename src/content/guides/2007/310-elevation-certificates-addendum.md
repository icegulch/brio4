Today, the Club is composed of active hikers whose travels in the
mountains keep us informed with the changing conditions of the White Mountain
backcountry. Each year, individuals, friends, and families, take up the
pastime of hiking. Somewhere along the way they get hooked on the pursuit of
hiking the four thousand footers. For some it is done as a _physical
challenge_. For others it's an opportunity to pursue a shared goal. For
families, it's a way to build bonds that will last a lifetime. It is the hope
of the Club that these experiences will keep our members working for the
preservation and wise use of wild country.
